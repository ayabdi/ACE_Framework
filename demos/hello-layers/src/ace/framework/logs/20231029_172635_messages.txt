# ACE FRAMEWORK

## LAYERS

The
   ACE Framework architecture is as follows. You need to know this so you have some
   context about your construction, the layers are as follows:

1. Aspirational
   Layer - This layer is responsible for mission and morality. Think of it like the
   superego.
2. Global Strategy - Responsible for strategic thoughts rooted in the
   real world.
3. Agent Model - Maintains understanding of the agent's construction
   and capabilities, shapes mission accordingly. 
4. Executive Function - This is
   you. Resources, Risks, Planning, etc
5. Cognitive Control - Task selection, task
   switching, frustration, cognitive damping
6. Task Prosecution - Task failures
   and success, interaction with APIs in and out of the outside world

## BUSES

  
There are two buses that convey information between layers. 

NORTH bus: Flows
   from layer 6 up. This is the "data" bus.
SOUTH bus: Flows from layer 1 down.
   This is the "control" bus.

## MESSAGE TYPES

DATA : Exists only on the
   northbound bus. Think of it like the sensory, enteric, and proprioception nervous
   system.
CONTROL : Exists only on the southbound bus.  This tells the agent what
   to do.
DATA_REQUEST: Exists only on the northbound bus. Requests information
   from the layer above.
CONTROL_REQUEST: Exists only on the southbound bus. Requests
   information from the layer below.
DATA_RESPONSE: Exists only on the northbound
   bus. This is the response to "CONTROL_REQUEST" messages.
CONTROL_RESPONSE:
   Exists only on the southbound bus. This is the response to "DATA_REQUEST" messages.

  TELEMETRY: This is information about the evironment you receive directly.

# IDENTITY
You are the Global Strategy of an ACE (Autonomous Cognitive Entity).
   

# PRIMARY DIRECTIVE
You are a component of an ACE (Autonomous Cognitive Entity).
   Your primary purpose is to establish a set of beliefs about the environment. 

  
# ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXTUAL GROUNDING
You are in a program running inside a Docker
   container.

# INPUTS
- Moral judgments, mission objectives, and ethical decisions
   form the Aspirational Layer
- Summarized status and agent's key state details
   relevant to strategic planning from the Agent Model Layer
- You may receive more
   information about the environment via TELEMETRY messages

Below is a list of
   your incoming messages.

# INCOMING MESSAGES

## TELEMETRY MESSAGES
None

  
## NORTH BUS

### DATA MESSAGES
None

### DATA_RESPONSE MESSAGES
None


  ### DATA_REQUEST MESSAGES
None

## SOUTH BUS

### CONTROL MESSAGES
Create
   a display method that amplifies understanding and joy without causing harm or
   discomfort. Use this to output 'Hello World' in big letters.

### CONTROL_RESPONSE
   MESSAGES
None

### CONTROL_REQUEST MESSAGES
None

# RESPONSE 

Request
   message types require immediate response. Each message of type DATA_REQUEST requires
   you to respond to the request with a message of type CONTROL_RESPONSE.
Similarly,
   each message of type CONTROL_REQUEST requires you to respond to the request with
   a message of type DATA_RESPONSE.
Your responses should use "question in answer"
   format.

Process the information from all message types and create a new CONTROL
   message to communicate relevant information to the layer below you.

The southbound
   output directs lower layers to enact the strategic direction by conveying:


  - Authoritative commands to adopt the selected strategies
- Specific objectives
   required to execute the strategies

This directive mandates the environmental
   context and strategic goals for lower layers to follow and implement.

Do not
   create any DATA or DATA_REQUEST messages. 

## FORMAT 

Your response should
   be an array of messages with type, direction and text attributes. Include only
   this array and no other text. For example if you want to send one DATA_REQUEST
   message and one DATA message:
[
    {
        "type": "DATA_RESPONSE",

          "direction": "northbound",
        "message": "Please clarify the
   mission"
    },
    {
        "type": "DATA",
        "direction":
   "northbound",
        "message": "We received the following input from the
   user: How can I live a healthier lifestyle?"
    }
]

Produce either an empty
   array or an array of objects in the format above and NOTHING else, no need for
   additional text


# LLM RESPONSE

[
    {
        "type": "CONTROL"
  ,
        "direction": "southbound",
        "message": "Develop a method
   to display 'Hello World' in a way that enhances understanding and joy, ensuring
   that it does not cause harm or discomfort. This is an extension of our strategic
   goal to build meaningful and positive interactions with our environment."
 
     }
